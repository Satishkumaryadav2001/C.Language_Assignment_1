Ques -1  Why do computers understand only binary Language ?

Ans : - Great question! Computers understand only **binary language** — the language of **1s and 0s** — because of the way their hardware is built. Here’s a simple breakdown:

### 1. **Electricity is either ON or OFF**
At the most basic level, computers are made of billions of tiny electrical switches called **transistors**. These transistors can be in one of two states:
- **ON** (electric current is flowing)
- **OFF** (no electric current)

These two states perfectly match binary:
- **1** = ON  
- **0** = OFF

So, using binary is the most natural and reliable way to represent data and instructions in a computer.

---

### 2. **Simplicity and Reliability**
Binary is:
- **Simple to implement in hardware** (only two states to detect)
- **Less prone to error** (easier to distinguish between just ON and OFF than, say, 10 different levels)

---

### 3. **Everything Can Be Represented in Binary**
Even complex things like:
- Text (like letters and emojis)
- Images
- Videos
- Instructions for software

…can all be broken down into binary using specific **encoding systems** (like ASCII for text or RGB for images).

---

So, in short: **computers use binary because it's the most efficient, reliable, and natural way to operate with the physical realities of electronics.**

Ques 9 How to convert a number from a decimal number system to a binary number system ?

Ans: - Converting a **decimal number** (base 10) to a **binary number** (base 2) is easy once you know the steps! Let's break it down. 🔢➡️💻

---

### ✅ **Steps to Convert Decimal to Binary (Whole Numbers):**

Use the **division by 2 method** — divide the number by 2 repeatedly and record the **remainders**.

#### **Step-by-step process:**
1. Divide the number by 2.
2. Record the **remainder** (either 0 or 1).
3. Update the number to the **quotient**.
4. Repeat until the quotient becomes 0.
5. **Read the remainders from bottom to top** – that’s your binary number!

---

### 🔍 Example: Convert **13** to Binary

| Division       | Quotient | Remainder |
|----------------|----------|-----------|
| 13 ÷ 2         | 6        | 1         |
| 6 ÷ 2          | 3        | 0         |
| 3 ÷ 2          | 1        | 1         |
| 1 ÷ 2          | 0        | 1         |

🔁 **Binary = Read bottom to top = `1101`**

---

### 🧠 Bonus: In C code, you could write this logic like:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void decimalToBinary(int n) {
    int binary[32], i = 0;

    while (n > 0) {
        binary[i] = n % 2;
        n = n / 2;
        i++;
    }

    // Print in reverse
    for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
        printf("%d", binary[j]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}

int main() {
    int number = 13;
    decimalToBinary(number);
    return 0;
}
```
